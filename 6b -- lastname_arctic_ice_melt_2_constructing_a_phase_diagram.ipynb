    "We have argued that human activity has changed the pattern of sea ice melt in the Arctic through the qualitative idea of ice-albedo feedback. Confidence in making predictions about the future requires quantitative treatment as well. In this CGI, you will explore this idea in two ways. First, you will estimate how _much_ energy is required to effect the seasonal melt of Arctic ice from April to September. Secondly, you will construct a phase diagram of water based on fundamental thermodynamic properties of water.  "

Then you'll need to rearrange the Clapeyron equation so that variables are separated, and integrate. For the starting point of the integrals, we'll use the triple point pressure and temperature. For the ending point of the integrals, we'll use the notation $P_{liq/vap}^*$. The integrated result is called the _Clausius-Clapeyron Equation_ for liquid-vapor equilibrium. Similar considerations apply to the solid-vapor equilibrium, with appropriate changes (i.e., $\\Delta V_{sub} \\approx V_{gas} \\approx RT/P$). The integrated result is also called a Clausius-Clapeyron equation, with $\\Delta H_{sub}$ instead $\\Delta H_{vap}$, and $P_{ice/vap}^*$ instead of $P_{liq/vap}^*$.
