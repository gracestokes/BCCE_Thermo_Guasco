    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An _equation of state_ is any algebraic expression that relates\n",
    "thermodynamic variables to one another. You’re probably familiar with the\n",
    "equation of state for an ideal gas, written algebraically as $PV=nRT$.\n",
    "Here, the pressure, volume, and temperature are thermodynamic variables; n\n",
    "tells you how much of the gas there is, and R is the gas constant. It’s\n",
    "clear from this equation that once we know any two thermodynamic\n",
    "variables, we can get the third, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: right;'>\n",
    "$ P(V,T) = \\dfrac{n R T}{V} $ (ideal gas) $\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad$(1)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven’t changed much in writing this; it’s still the equation of state for an ideal gas. But by writing _P(V,T)_ on the left hand side, we are signaling that we’re thinking about pressure as a _state function_ (because it depends on _T_ and _V_). Variables _T_ and _V_, the independent variables in this equation, define a two-dimensional _state space_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 1 can be thought of geometrically as a surface in two dimensions. Josiah Willard Gibbs called these _thermodynamic surfaces_. James Clerk Maxwell famously made three plaster models of a thermodynamic surface, and gave one as a present to Gibbs. A photo of one is shown in Fig. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Maxwell_thermodynamic_surface.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1. Thermodynamic surface of the energy of an idealized water-like substance constructed by James Clerk Maxwell as a gift to Josiah Willard Gibbs.$^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of thermodynamic surfaces is quite general. The plaster model Maxwell gave to Gibbs showed the energy (_U_) as a function of the volume and entropy (_V_ and _S_) of an idealized water-like substance, which we would write shorthand as _U(V,S)_. But an important point is that _all_ substances (real or idealized) are characterized by thermodynamic surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you visualize what the thermodynamic surface _P(V,T)_ of a gas looks like? One approach is to imagine how pressure behaves as a function of each variable separately. That is exactly what various early investigators did. Two 17th century British scientists, Boyle and Hooke, found that when the volume of a gas is changed isothermally (temperature held constant), the gas pressure goes as the inverse of the volume. A century and a half later, French chemist Gay-Lussac reported that when the temperature of a gas is changed isochorically (volume held constant), the pressure goes up in direct proportion to the temperature. These properties are also easily obtained from Eq. 1, by the way, but Gay-Lussac, Boyle, and Hooke didn’t have that advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still struggling with visualizing _P(V,T)_ even with these insights, don’t worry: that’s the sort of thing computers are good at, and what you’ll be asking Python to do for you in this computational lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Eq. 1 does not describe real gases exactly; under some physical conditions, it’s a pretty good approximation, but under other physical conditions, large deviations from the real behavior are seen. That’s unfortunate in one sense, because it means real gases can’t be described with the algebraic elegance of Eq. 1. On the other hand, it turns out that the way a real gas differs from ideal-gas behavior can reveal important information about the gas molecules! A formula derived by van der Waals$^1$, \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: right;'>\n",
    "$ P(V,T) = \\dfrac{n R T}{V-nb} -\\dfrac{an^2}{V^2} $ (van der Waals gas) $\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad $ (2)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "is a kind of compromise: it is not quite as elegant (or at least simple) as the ideal gas equation of state, but it has the great advantage that it describes real gases much better, because parameters _a_ and _b_ are adjusted for each gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re interested in the error (difference) between these two ways of describing a gas, the formula is\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: right;'>\n",
    "$ \\%Error = \\dfrac{P_{ideal}-P_{vdw}}{P_{vdw}}x100\\% $ $\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad$ (3)\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula assumes the van der Waals result is more accurate, which is generally accepted to be the case for most physical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this computational lab, you will use Python to generate and manipulate thermodynamic surfaces for ideal gases and for van der Waals gases.\n",
