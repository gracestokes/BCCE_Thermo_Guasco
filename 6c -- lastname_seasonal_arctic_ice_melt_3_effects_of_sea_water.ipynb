    "We have argued that human activity has changed the composition of the atmosphere, changed the pattern of sea ice melt in the Arctic, and that proper modeling of climate depends on quantitative representation of the thermodynamics of sea ice. We have estimated the energy needed to effect the seasonal melting of Arctic sea ice. In this CGI, we will refine this idea a little. Specifically, we'll be exploring what difference it makes that the ice is forming from seawater, and is in equilibrium with it. Both are definite, measureable effects that could potentially impact climate predictions."

What difference does that make? One difference is that ice freezes at a lower temperature when it is exposed to salty water (this is why salt is sometimes applied to icy roads). Another difference is that the reduction in freezing point will cause a slight change in the enthalpy of melting, $\\Delta H_{fus}$. We'll take up the theory behind these two effects next."
